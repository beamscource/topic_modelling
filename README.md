# topic_modelling
Scripts and helper functions for semi-supervised topic modelling of Russian and Ukrainian texts with Anchored CorEx models (https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic)

The script can also serve as a brief tutorial into lemmatization, vocabulary vectorization and auto-tagging of texts. Tagging, for instance, can be later used to train a NLU intent classification model.

explore_topic.py might be especially useful for quickly exploring topic models with different parameters.
